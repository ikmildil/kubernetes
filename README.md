These scripts have been tested on both Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 editions. I recommend 20.04 edition if possible because I have used this extensively in my own lab. The only difference regarding 22.04 that I came across was that while running scripts, the following  message  kept occurring which can be ignored.
